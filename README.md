# SF-Crime-Aware-Navigator
Developed a Python-based backend for crime-aware route optimization, including a class-weighted Random Forest classifier trained on spatiotemporal features from SFPD crime data. Engineered an intelligent rerouting system using OpenRouteService API and dynamic polygon generation to avoid high-risk areas based on real-time risk predictions.
